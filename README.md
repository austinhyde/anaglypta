# Anaglypta

You ever wake up one day, log onto your computer, realize you don't like your wallpaper,
go to change it, and wind up squinting at your OS's wallpaper picker and spending 10 minutes
trying to find the wallpaper you want?

I do this at least once a month, and I'm tired of it. I want a wallpaper picker that doesn't suck.

This is (/ will be) that app.
